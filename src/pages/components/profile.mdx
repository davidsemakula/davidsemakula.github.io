🔭 I'm currently working on:

### 🔑 [Cryptographic][crypto] protocols and libraries

- 🚧 [Wamu][wamu]
  - 📖 A protocol and library for computation of [threshold signatures] by multiple [decentralized identities][did].
  - 🌱 Funded by: the [Ethereum Foundation][EF] ([announcement][EF-announcement]).

### ⚒️ Tools for programming languages and [program analysis]

- 🚧 [pallet-verifier]
  - 📖 A tool for detecting [common security vulnerabilities][vulnerabilities] and [insecure patterns] in
    [FRAME pallets][FRAME] using [static program analysis][static-analysis] techniques like [data-flow analysis][data-flow],
    [abstract interpretation][abs-int] and [symbolic execution][symbex].
- 🚀 [ink! Analyzer][ink-analyzer]
  - 📖 A collection of modular and reusable libraries and tools for [semantic analysis] of [ink!] smart contracts.
  - 🌱 Funded by: the [Web3 Foundation][W3F] ([announcement][W3F-announcement]).
- 🛟 Open-source contributions
  - I independently make [contributions][ra-contributions] to [rust-analyzer] - a [Rust] compiler front-end for IDEs.
  - I independently make [contributions][MIRAI-contributions] to [MIRAI] - an [abstract interpreter][abs-int]
    for the [Rust] compiler's [mid-level intermediate representation (MIR)][MIR].

🌱 Some of my independent [open-source] projects are funded by industry-leading organizations like the [Ethereum Foundation][EF]
and the [Web3 Foundation][W3F].

⚡ I’ve previously worked as a technical lead on projects for:

- [HubSpot], [Telegraaf Media Groep (TMG)][TMG], [Pressboard], [Permobil], [ButterflyWorks], [InboundLabs]
  and many more companies and agencies - as a [contractor]
- [Tunga] and [Grindery] - as [C.T.O (Chief Technology Officer)][CTO]
- [True African] - as a [Senior Software Engineer][SWE]

🎓 I hold a [BSc in Computer Science][MAK].
